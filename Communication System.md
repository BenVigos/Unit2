## Planning 
### Identified Problem 

### Proposed Solution 
We are using an arduino set because, despite it being small and portable, has a lot of potential power -- it is a very popular hard-ware used when creating a new device because of it's accessibility and also flexibility in projects. It's accessibility is due to its simple circuit system, needing only to be plugged in with a computer via USB, and because it uses C++. C++, while a more difficult langauge than Python or Java, is still understandable to a beginner student and it gives you more control (for instance, memory management). Also, C++ is a very common langauge, with many platforms and applications written in C++ and also with many learning-resources available online. 

### Success Criteria 
Based on the conversation we  had with the client, these were the success criteria agreed upon: 

1. Must use one LCD, one arduino, two buttons, and one LED 
1. Must include a table which informs the operator with the instructions 
1. Must allow the user to enter Englishs and output in either morse code or binary 
1. Must allow the user to enter either morse code or binary and output to English
1. Must be able to carry out the commands delete, error, acknowledge, send and SOS 
1. Must be able to send at least 10 words per minute
